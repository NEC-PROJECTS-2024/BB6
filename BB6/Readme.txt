#introduction
A branch of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" uses various data and algorithms to define the way humans learning, with the ultimate goal of improving accuracy over time. Therefore, ML is helpful in building the model using various techniques, and it is then tested and trained on this massive amount of data. ML uses sophisticated statistical and probabilistic approaches to create computers that can learn from data. A crucial element of ML is the dataset. The dataset should be as accurate as possible because even a small change in the data could have a big impact on the outcome. Supervised machine learning is applied to a Netflix Finance dataset in this study.
This dataset has five variables: volume, open, close, low, and high. The terms "open, close, low, and high" relate to different, nearlyidentical bid prices for the stocks at differenttimes. The quantity of shares that were exchanged during the transaction is referred to as the volume. The model is then tested using the test data.Regression and decision tree models are employed separately in this work. Regression reduces errors, but decision trees store data and outcomes for a longer period of time. Moreover, graphs showing the regression-based model's projected and actual prices as well as the price change over time are given. There's also the k-nearest- neighbor method.
